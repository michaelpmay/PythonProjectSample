Sample code from Python automation project

Here you can find some same code that was taken from a much larger Python Automation project. That project aims to take large amounts of data using an Acquire-Process-Decide feedback loop, and scale image process calculations over a cluster of machines.

The main goal of the team is to create smart microscopy tools that uses statistical theories and microscope automation to propose experiments with the most information possible.

We were able to create a custom built fluorescent microscope by aligning optical components, writing C++ driver code, developing Python Automation code.

The responsibility of the automation project was to write code in Python that could collect large amounts of data that could maximize the amount of information gathered despite measurement distortions.

We used automation to gather large amounts of data under different experimental conditions and examined how measured protein levels changed under different conditions using a simple linear operator

We derived new mathematics on experimental measurement distortions with Fisher information and gathered a large dataset using the automated microscope that could measure "probability distortion operators" of real microscopes.

As a side project, we utilized convolutional neural nets and wrote galvo driver code to destroy cells with undesired phenotypes.
