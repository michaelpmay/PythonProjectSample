# PythonProjectSample from Python automation project
ProjectSample

Here you can find some same code that was taken from a much larger Python Automation project. That project aims to take large ammounts of images using an Acuquire-Process-Decide feedback loop, and scale image process calculations over a cluster of machines.

The main of the automation project is to create smart microscopy tools that uses statistical theories and microscope automation to measure experiments with the most information possible.

We were able to create a custom built fluorescnt microscope by aligning optical components and writing C++ driver code.

As a side project, we utillized Convolutional neural nets and wrote galvo driver code to destroy cells with undesired phenotypes.
