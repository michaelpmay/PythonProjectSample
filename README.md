# PythonProjectSample from Python automation project
ProjectSample

Here you can find some same code that was taken from a much larger Python Automation project. That project aims to take large amounts of data using an Acuquire-Process-Decide feedback loop, and scale image process calculations over a cluster of machines.

The main goal of the automation project is to create smart microscopy tools that uses statistical theories and microscope automation to measure experiments with the most information possible.

The responsibility of this project was to write automation code in python that could collect large ammounts of data that could answer these questions.

We were able to create a custom built fluorescnt microscope by aligning optical components and writing C++ driver code.

We derived new mathemtics on experimental measurement distortions with Fisher information and gathered a large dataset using the automated microscope that could measure "distortion operators" of real microscopes.

As a side project, we utillized Convolutional neural nets and wrote galvo driver code to destroy cells with undesired phenotypes.
